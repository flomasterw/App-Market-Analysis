This is a final project for a Statistics course from UC Davis. The original project notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/fsywang/App-Market-Analysis/blob/master/script/full-project-notebook.ipynb).

# Motivatin

We are curious about market performance for both Apple Store and Google Play Store. Suppose we are going to develop a successful app, we want to discover the user preference for different categories of applications, price distribution for paid applications, and factors that influence rating.

# Data

- [Google Play Store Apps from Kaggles](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps)
